#Triangle Checker

---

## Synopsis

Triangle Checker is an exciting app that informs you of the type of triangle your three values will create. Will it be equilateral? Isosceles?! Scalene?! Or not a triangle at all?

## Installation

Triangle Checker uses the following gems:

  - Capybara
  - Sinatra
  - RSpec

  
## Tests

  Both method and integration tests for Word Frequency utilize the RSpec. Simply run `gem install rspec`, if it's not already installed, and then the command `rspec`, while located in the project's file.
