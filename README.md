#Triangle Checker

---

## Synopsis

Triangle Checker is an exciting app that informs you of the type of triangle (if any) three given values will create. Will it be equilateral? Isosceles?! Scalene?! Or not a triangle at all? This riveting program was crafted by [Courtney Phillips](https://github.com/courtneyphillips) and [Garrett Olson](https://github.com/garedean) as part of the Spring 2015 Ruby course curriculum at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/).

## Installation

Triangle Checker uses the following gems:

  - Capybara
  - Sinatra
  - RSpec

running `$ gem install bundle` from the terminal will install all necessary gems. 
  
## Tests

Tests for Triangle Checker utilize RSpec and Capybara. If you haven't already bundle installed as detailed above, simply run `gem install rspec`, and/or `$ gem install capybara` to gather the necessary gems.

Run `$ rspec` within the terminal to run tests.
